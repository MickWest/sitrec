First edit:
config/config.js.example
and
config/config-install.js.example
(rename to remove .example, edit paths)

cd sitrec_source

install all the mode packages with
npm install

build with:
npm run build

This just runs the script in package.json, but in the node environment. Webpack is part of node.
so needs to be in that environment (i.e. NOT brew install webpack).
Also some packages used by the Sitrec client are from node.

See webpack.common.js for details of what is copied over


npm run deploy

will build an optimized version into the deploy folder, which can then be copied into the web root.

For file uploading, currently we ust use the POST method, which
require a change to the default PH install to allow larger files
(Paths here are Mick's, included as examples)

php.ini in:
/opt/homebrew/etc/php/8.2/php.ini

upload_max_filesize = 100M
post_max_size = 100M

restart it with:
brew services restart php

nginx.conf in
/usr/local/etc/nginx/nginx.conf

http {
    ...
    client_max_body_size 100M;
}

restart:
sudo nginx -s reload
